Algorithm

1. Creating a class for our div

2. in the constructor, we add some parameters

3. Creating a method for directly creating a div and adding it to the document

4. in the same method, we create a parameter in the form of a string that we need to style the created block using cssText

5. Styling our div

That is all. Create objects of our class as many times as you want using different parameters.
